The setting is directly lifted from the early '70s disaster science-fiction book and movie \"Nippon Chinbotsu,\" (Japan Sinks) while many of the characters are allegorical to the key players in the Eastern classic \"Sangokushi\" (The Three Kingdoms). Sangokushi aficionados may discover greater entertainment by watching the characters in A Spirit of the Sun closely to spot these resemblances.

Parties had a limitation of 5 members, and I was told that an unpopular job like Black Sorcerer would only get in the way of getting to 3rd place or beyond.",
